# Speaker Info
I am an avid Pythonista and an Open-Source Enthusiast.  
Since moving to Noida three years ago, I've always been a community guy, whether organizing workshops in college or spending weekends attending meetups and conferences all over Delhi-NCR at PyDelhi, PyData, ILUG-D, AWS and GDG.  
Recently I've started working on developing cross-platform apps and it feels great for a change, after being a back-end dev. for so long.
